A C++ program that manages student records using various data structures and algorithms.

Features

Data Structures:
  - Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient student record storage
  - Queue for managing deletion requests

Operations:
  - Add, display, update, and delete student records
  - Search by roll number (binary search) or name (linear search)
  - Sort records by name (merge sort) or roll number (bubble sort)
  - Batch deletion processing using a queue system

- Student Information:
  - Name
  - Roll number
  - GPA

How to Use:

1. Compile the program (single .cpp file)
2. Run the executable
3. Use the menu system to:
   - Add new student records
   - View all records (sorted in BST order)
   - Search for specific students
   - Sort and display records differently
   - Update existing records
   - Queue and process deletion requests
